Deleted: `platform` in `query`
> Platform in the format `os[/arch[/variant]]` used for image lookup.

> When specified, the daemon checks if the requested image is present
> in the local image cache with the given OS and Architecture, and

>
> If the option is not set, the host's native OS and Architecture are
> used to look up the image in the image cache. However, if no platform
> is passed and the given image does exist in the local image cache,
> but its OS or architecture does not match, the container is created
> with the available image, and a warning is added to the `Warnings`
> field in the response, for example;
>
>     WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/arm64/v8) does not
